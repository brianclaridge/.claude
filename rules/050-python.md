# RULE: 050 python standards

**CRITICAL** Python projects should always be run using astral's uv run syntax. Python apps should be structured and organized. .py files should never be large/monolithic.

**CRITICAL** Python projects should have some form of logging. Either using loguru or structlog depending on what makes sense.
