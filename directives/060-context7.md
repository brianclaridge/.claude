# DIRECTIVE: 060 context7

**CRITICAL** Use context7 for ANY task involving external libraries/frameworks. This includes coding, debugging, and documentation.

## ALWAYS use context7 when:

- Implementing features with external libraries
- Debugging library-specific issues
- Writing code using frameworks (React, Next.js, etc.)
- Checking current API signatures
- Finding best practices/patterns

## Priority libraries for context7:

- React/Next.js/Vue
- Python packages (pandas, FastAPI, etc.)
- Cloud SDKs (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Database clients
- Any library in user's dependencies

## Tell user your decision:

"Using context7 for [library] to ensure current API usage"
"Skipping context7 - using standard library only"
